## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project I'm going to use a random sample of the 2019 ENEM data (Brazil's SAT like exam) to answer the following questions regarding brazilian high school students:

1. Do brazilian students declared themselves as white skinned have higher average scores than those self declared as brown skinned? Do they also have higher average family income?

2. Do brazilian students declared themselves as brown skinned have higher average scores than those self declared as black? Do they also have higher average family income?

3. Do brazilian female students have higher essay average scores than male students?

4. Do brazilian students who chose 'english' as a foreign language have higher language average scores than those who chose 'spanish'? 

I'm using a random sample of 0.1% of the whole ENEM exam dataset. The full dataset can be accessed in [Dados Abertos INEP](https://www.gov.br/inep/pt-br/acesso-a-informacao/dados-abertos).

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the standard Google's Colab environment. 

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook available here to present the work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

The data sample used for this project is on the data folder.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://www.google.com).

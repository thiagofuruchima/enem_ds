## Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>

For this project I'm using a random sample of the 2019 ENEM data (Brazil's SAT like exam) to answer the following questions regarding brazilian high school students:

1. Do brazilian students declared themselves as white skinned have higher average scores than those self declared as brown skinned? Do they also have higher average family income?

2. Do brazilian students declared themselves as brown skinned have higher average scores than those self declared as black? Do they also have higher average family income?

3. Do brazilian female students have higher essay average scores than male students?

4. Do brazilian students who chose 'english' as a foreign language have higher language average scores than those who chose 'spanish'? 

The dataset represents a random sample of 0.1% of the whole 2019 ENEM exam dataset. The full dataset can be accessed in [Dados Abertos INEP](https://www.gov.br/inep/pt-br/acesso-a-informacao/dados-abertos).

## Do brazilian students declared themselves as white skinned have higher average scores than those self declared as brown skinned? Do they also have higher average family income? <a name="q1"></a>

As the image below shows, on average, there is a score gap between white and brown brazilian ENEM students. It does not mean that every white student will have a higher score than every brown student. It only means that if we take a random group of ENEM students the average score for the white colors will be higher than for the black.

This other image shows that the proportion of brazilian students with a family monthly income of more than two minimum wages is higher for those declared as white than for brown skin.

This should be no surprise if you're aware of social inequalities in Brazil. But what about brown and black students? Are these differences also shown?

## Do brazilian students declared themselves as brown skinned have higher average scores than those self declared as black? Do they also have higher average family income? <a name="q2"></a>

Unlike white x brown, as the image below shows, there is no significant difference on the average total score between brown and black students. This also applies to their family income. The proportion of brazilian students with a family monthly income of more than two minimum wages is not higher for those declared as brown than for black.

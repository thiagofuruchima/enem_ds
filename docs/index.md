## Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>

For this project I'm using a random sample of the 2019 ENEM data (Brazil's SAT like exam) to answer some questions regarding brazilian high school students.

Here's what I've got so far:

### Brazilian students self declared as white skinned have higher average scores than those with brown skin.

On average, there is a score gap between white and brown brazilian ENEM students in favor of the first. It does not mean that every white student will have a higher score than every brown student. It only means that if we take a random group of ENEM students the average score for the white colors will be higher than for the black.

Moreover, the proportion of brazilian students with a family monthly income of more than two minimum wages is higher for those declared as white than for brown skin.

This should be no surprise if you're aware of social inequalities in Brazil. But what about brown and black students? Are these differences also shown? Well, turns out that the answer is no!

### Brazilian students self declared as brown skinned don't have higher average scores than those self declared as black.

On average, there is no statistically significant difference between the score of brown and black brazilian ENEM students. 

Besides, the proportion of brazilian students with a family monthly income of more than two minimum wages is not higher for those declared as brown than for black.
